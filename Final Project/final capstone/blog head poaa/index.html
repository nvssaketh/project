            Agricultural analytics leverages data-driven techniques to optimize farming, enhancing productivity,
            reducing costs, and promoting sustainability. By collecting and analyzing data from sources like satellite
            imagery and sensors, farmers can make informed decisions about crop management, resource allocation, and
            risk mitigation.
